- [x] Set up widget build system with npm and webpack
- [x] Created documentation for widget usage (`WIDGET.md`)

**Deliverables:**
- `frontend/components/ChatWidget.tsx` - Main embeddable widget component
- `frontend/app/widget/page.tsx` - Widget demo page within the Next.js app
- `widget-build/` - Complete standalone build system with webpack
- `widget-build/dist/knowme-widget.js` - Production-ready widget bundle
- `widget-build/dist/embed.js` - Easy embed script for external sites
- `widget-build/test-site.html` - Comprehensive test site with examples
- `WIDGET.md` - Complete widget documentation and integration guide

**Features Implemented:**
- Floating chat button with expand/collapse
- Real-time streaming chat responses
- Customizable themes and colors
- Multiple positioning options (4 corners)
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Easy integration methods (embed script + manual)
- Shadow DOM isolation for style safety
- Error handling and loading states
- Auto-scroll and typing indicators
- Production-ready webpack build
- Comprehensive documentation

**Integration Methods:**
1. **Simple Embed**: Single script tag with data attributes
2. **Manual Init**: Full control with JavaScript configuration
3. **Auto-detect**: Automatic initialization from script attributes

**Technical Stack:**
- React 18 with TypeScript
- Webpack 5 for bundling
- Inline SVG icons (no external dependencies)
- Streaming fetch API for real-time chat
- CSS-in-JS for isolated styling
- UMD build for universal compatibility

**Testing:**
- Backend server running on port 8000
- Test site served on port 3000
- Widget successfully integrated and functional
- Theme switching and positioning tested
- Responsive design verified

## Discovered During Work

- Widget build system requires separate package.json and webpack config
- React/ReactDOM externalized to reduce bundle size
- Shadow DOM consideration for future style isolation
- CORS configuration needed for production deployment
- Multiple integration methods increase adoption flexibility

## Next Steps (Future Enhancements)

- [ ] Implement Shadow DOM for complete style isolation
- [ ] Add widget analytics and usage tracking
- [ ] Create WordPress plugin version
- [ ] Add widget customization UI for non-technical users
- [ ] Implement widget A/B testing capabilities
- [ ] Add multi-language support
